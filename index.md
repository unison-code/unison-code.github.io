Unison is a simple, flexible, and potentially optimal tool that performs
integrated [register
allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation) and [instruction
scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_scheduling) using
[constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
as a modern method for combinatorial optimization.

Unison can be used as an alternative or as a complement to the algorithms
provided by the state-of-the-art [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler. Why? How?
